Changelog
=========

0.3a (unreleased)
-----------------

- The auto-append functionality did not bind correctly for popup forms.
  I switched to using jQuery.live() instead of binding at document load time.

- Added a menu to the demo pages

- Added a display only form option.

- Fixed the restructured text of the main README.txt so that it will show
  more friendly in PyPI.
