Changelog
=========

0.6 (Unreleased)
----------------

    * Depend on collective.z3cform.datagridfield_demo as a test extra;
      use the browser view from this package in the tests.
      [maurits]

    * _validate still used when import/exporting, fix up code so it works
      [lentinj]

    * Add a DictRow serializer for transmogrify.dexterity
      [lentinj]

    * Only use width:100% on input cells that are the only element in the cell
      [lentinj]

    * Reorder row indices backwards when adding rows. This means that adjacent
      rows don't share the same index temporarily, for example:-
      - Row 1 and 2 contain input:radio based widgets
      - Row 0 added, row renumbering starts
      - Row 1 widgets renamed 2
      - Both sets of input:radio share the same name, one deselected
      - Row 2 widgets renamed 3
      - . . . 
      [lentinj]

    * Use jQuery to clone rows, and clone the jQuery events on the rows.
      [lentinj]

    * Implemented reorder functionality

0.4 (2011-02-06)
----------------

    * Renamed the demo pages. The starting point is now @@demo-collective.z3cform.datagrid .

    * The widget can now be configured via the updateWidgets method. It
      is no longer necessary to create a custom factory.

    * Provide a set of demo views for Object access.

0.3 (2011-02-04)
----------------

    * The auto-append functionality did not bind correctly for popup forms.

    * Added a menu to the demo pages

    * Added a display only form option.

    * Fixed the restructured text of the main README.txt so that it will show
      more friendly in PyPI.
